# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an iOS application that enables users to interact with the GLM-4.5-Air AI model through voice input. The application will capture voice input from users, convert it to text, send it to the GLM-4.5-Air API, and provide streaming responses back to the user in real-time. The application will provide a seamless voice-to-AI conversation experience with visual feedback and streaming text display.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record my voice input and have it converted to text, so that I can communicate with the AI model without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the record button THEN the system SHALL start capturing audio input from the device microphone
2. WHEN audio recording is active THEN the system SHALL display visual feedback indicating recording is in progress
3. WHEN the user stops recording THEN the system SHALL convert the audio to text using iOS Speech Recognition
4. WHEN speech-to-text conversion completes THEN the system SHALL display the converted text to the user
5. IF speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send my voice-converted text to the GLM-4.5-Air model, so that I can receive AI-generated responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is successfully converted from speech THEN the system SHALL automatically send the text to the GLM-4.5-Air API
2. WHEN sending the request THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers and model parameters
3. WHEN the API request is in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
5. WHEN the API responds THEN the system SHALL begin processing the streaming response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the AI response appear in real-time as it's being generated, so that I can follow the conversation naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GLM-4.5-Air API starts streaming response THEN the system SHALL display text chunks as they arrive
2. WHEN new text chunks arrive THEN the system SHALL append them to the existing response without flickering
3. WHEN the streaming response is complete THEN the system SHALL indicate completion status
4. WHEN displaying responses THEN the system SHALL maintain proper formatting and readability
5. IF streaming is interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle partial responses gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a conversation history, so that I can review previous exchanges with the AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation exchange completes THEN the system SHALL save both user input and AI response to conversation history
2. WHEN displaying conversation history THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between user messages and AI responses
3. WHEN the app is reopened THEN the system SHALL restore the previous conversation history
4. WHEN conversation history becomes long THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling capabilities
5. WHEN user wants to clear history THEN the system SHALL provide a clear conversation option

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling and feedback, so that I understand what's happening when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN microphone access is denied THEN the system SHALL display instructions for enabling microphone permissions
2. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL display appropriate network error messages
3. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL display rate limit information and suggested wait times
4. WHEN speech recognition is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide alternative input methods
5. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debugging information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have an intuitive and responsive interface, so that voice interaction feels natural and smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a clean interface with prominent voice input button
2. WHEN voice recording is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with recording animation
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use readable fonts and proper spacing
5. WHEN the interface updates THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
